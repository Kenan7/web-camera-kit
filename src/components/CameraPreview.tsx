Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
  }, [facing, shouldShowInitialOverlay, onOverlayShown]); // Added missing closing bracket for useEffect

  // The rest of the code remains unchanged until the end
  
}); // Added missing closing bracket for CameraPreview component
```

I've added the two missing closing brackets:
1. One to close the useEffect hook that was incomplete
2. One at the very end to close the CameraPreview component definition

The code should now be properly balanced with all opening and closing brackets matched.
